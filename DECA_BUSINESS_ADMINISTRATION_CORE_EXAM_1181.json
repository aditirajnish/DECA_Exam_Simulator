Failure to pay close attention may result in the applicants giving incorrect information or not completely answering the questions. Not listening also may indicate to an interviewer that an applicant is not interested in the position. Applicants should not read materials while an interviewer is asking questions. While applicants are expected to talk and share information about themselves during job interviews, they should choose their words carefully and not talk excessively. On occasion, applicants may write notes about what the interviewer is saying, but they should not let that interfere with their ability to listen carefully. SOURCE: PD:028 SOURCE: McMullen, L.

Applicants provide copies of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s before the interview. The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or job application should contain the names of references.
